# EmailScraper v2

## Description
EmailScraper v2 is an enhanced Python tool designed to extract email addresses from websites while crawling internal links up to a specified depth. Unlike traditional scrapers, this tool dynamically follows internal links, collects new email addresses in real-time, and stores all extracted data in structured files. The script ensures stability, optimized crawling, and efficient progress tracking.

## Updates & Enhancements
Recursion Control: The user can specify the depth of crawling using -r X. If not specified, it defaults to 1 level.
<< Optimized Progress Bar: Now, only one progress bar is shown per recursion level, keeping output clean and readable.
<< Automatic Data Storage: Emails and links are progressively saved into EmailExtracted.txt and links.txt.
<< Background Execution & Stability: Crawling runs smoothly, avoiding crashes due to HTML parsing errors.
<< Graceful Exit with Ctrl+C: If interrupted, the script saves progress before exiting.
<< Content-Type Validation: Ensures only valid HTML pages are processed, preventing crashes on non-HTML responses.
